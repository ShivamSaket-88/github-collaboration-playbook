# GitHub Branches

## What is a branch?
A branch is a separate copy of the code used to work safely without
affecting the main branch.

## Why are branches used?
- To work on new features
- To fix bugs safely
- To avoid breaking the main code

## Basic rule
Never make major changes directly on the main branch.
Always create a new branch for work.
